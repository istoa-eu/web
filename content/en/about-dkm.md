We develop dynamic simulations that we call *Dynamic Knowledge Model*
-- DKM.

**What is it for?** To visualize knowledge in the form of small
dynamic components, in order to enrich the discovery and learning
experience.

**What is it exactly?** Computer models, independent of each other, to represent and show in a dynamic form the knowledge learned at school.

The fields of knowledge covered are hard sciences, human sciences and
any other field whose knowledge can be relevantly represented in a
computer model.

**Who is it for?** Teachers, parents, learners, the curious, and
developers or apprentice developers.

**How is it made?** Each DKM is a self-sufficient unit that operates
independently within its *iStoa* environment, without dependence on
the Internet. A DKM instance is created using a script in the
Smalltalk language, often very short. Creating instances by script is
faster than with a mouse, the variability is almost infinite and it
can potentially be stimulated by AI.

**What it is not.** An e-tutoring or quiz system.
