title: Our Actions
---

We develop software and documentation for learning programming.

* DKMs distributed within the *iStoa* simulation environment; see the
  [Download](/download) page.
* [Dr. Geo](http://gnu.org/s/dr-geo), an interactive geometry and
  programming environment. It was within this application that the DKM
  concept was developed for the field of geometry. It is actively used
  with lower secondary school students to introduce programming.
* iStoa.net (not publicly available), as part of a research project on
  artifacts, pedagogical scaffolding, and conceptual guidance.
* Books to strengthen computer literacy through coding:
   * [The Cuis Book](https://drcuis.github.io/TheCuisBook/), for
     learning programming with the [Cuis-Smalltalk](http://cuis)
     environment.
   * The Morph Books, [vol. I](https://drcuis.github.io/DesignGUI) &
     [vol. II](https://drcuis.github.io/TheArtOfMorph), for developing
     GUI applications within the Cuis-Smalltalk environment.
   * [Programming with
     Dr. Geo](https://www.gnu.org/software/dr-geo/doc/fr/programming)
     for lower secondary school.
