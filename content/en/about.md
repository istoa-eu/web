title: About iStoa
---

iStoa was born from the [research
work](https://theses.fr/2010LIL10028) of Hilaire Fernandes regarding
learning environments. One aspect of this work focused on [artifacts
as learning
objects](https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/Team/Texts/Papers/Fern08a-C5-istoa-exercises.pdf).

To address the wide variety of learning situations, these artifacts
are customizable; thus, they can be integrated into various
pedagogical scenarios designed by educators within a dedicated
learning environment.

### Dynamic Knowledge Model (DKM)

The DKM build upon this idea of knowledge scripting for **dynamic
simulations**, also known as **micro-worlds**. Customization is no
longer done through simple parameters but via script that offers
greater flexibility. The DKM incorporate the scripting work developed
in our [Dr. Geo](http://gnu.org/s/dr-geo) project and their use in
introductory [programming courses for secondary school
students](https://gnu-drgeo.blogspot.com/search/label/DrGeoKid).

### Our Vision

We believe that a digital culture, **enriched by code**, strengthens
general knowledge and the appropriation of information, particularly
in the sciences, though not exclusively. Writing a small program
mobilizes and reinforces several key notions in Mathematics, planning,
rigor, communication, critical thinking.

The DKM, through their design and usage, are intended to also
reinforce these aspects.

### Technical Environment

We use the [Cuis-Smalltalk](http://cuis.st) environment as a
development and distribution platform for our software. It brings
together valuable features such as easy access to code, live
programming, a vector graphics environment, a virtual machine
optimized for multiple operating systems.
