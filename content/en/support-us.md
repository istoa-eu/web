title: Support us
---

We want to make the dynamic models we develop available to as many
people as possible. In the era of computational thinking, writing
scripts to design simulations based on these dynamic models is an
original and enriching approach to computing, and to learning more
generally.

There are many ways to support our work. Whether you are a teacher, a
university professor, a parent, a learner, an occasional or seasoned
developer, you have different possible approaches to support us.

### Financial Support

Developing and promoting this work requires resources in time and
material means. For each [DKM module](dkm) that we develop, our final
goal is to make it available to the public under an **open license**
[LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html#license-text). However,
its development is not free, and we offer crowdfunding directly from
its descriptive page.

Until its development cost is covered, any DKM already developed is
available under the **non-free license** [CC
by-nc-nd](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

The funding raised helps in the development of the objectives of the
iStoa organisation.

For other forms of support, do not hesitate to contact us.

### Teacher

* Write scripts to create simulations in your classes.

* Set up classes where your students are active participants using
  [the iStoa environment](download). Different goals are possible:
  teaching computer programming; teaching your discipline, other than
  computing, by having your students write simulation scenarios; or
  even better, both at the same time.

   Our experience in writing scripts to design simulations shows that
   it is very stimulating for students, regardless of their academic
   level. Educational sequences must, of course, be carefully
   crafted. Do not hesitate to contact us if you need help.

* Share your experience by highlighting it in educational journals or
  on your blog, if you have one.


### Learner 

As such, you can learn the basics of programming and express your
creativity. To do this, in [the iStoa environment](download), you
choose a DKM that interests you and experiment with writing scripts in
that field. Do not hesitate to share your experiences with us!

### University Professor 

* In teaching computer science or related fields, for year-end
  assignments or any other long-term project, proposing to your
  students to imagine and develop new DKMs, at the intersection of
  several disciplinary fields, can be very stimulating. We have
  developed [several documentations](our-actions) on programming, and
  in particular with the Cuis-Smalltalk environment.

* In the context of didactics, research work on the pedagogical impact
  of DKMs would be an interesting contribution. This would help
  corroborate, or not, what we observe in the field. More modestly,
  designing pedagogical sequences of DKM scenarios, to be validated in
  the field, is a pragmatic and relatively rewarding approach to
  pedagogical innovation. Read [our articles on this
  subject](https://gnu-drgeo.blogspot.com/search/label/DrGeoKid).

Do not hesitate to contact us to discuss research ideas.

### Developer 

If you enjoy software development, you will find the experience of
designing a DKM both intellectually stimulating, rewarding, and
relaxing:

* **Stimulating.** The field is wide open to deepen your knowledge in
  one or more subjects taught at school. If needed, the theoretical
  knowledge required to develop a model can be enriched with the help
  of an AI.

* **Rewarding.** The development of a DKM, due to its deliberately
  reduced scope, quickly yields operational results. For example, the
  source code of the gas simulation DKM is less than 40 KB (less than
  1000 lines of code).
  
* **Relaxing.** The development of our DKMs is done in the
  [Cuis-Smalltalk](https://cuis.st) agile environment. Among its many
  strengths, the jointly *incremental* and *live* development avoids
  the classic disruption of the *compile-run-debug-edit* development,
  a source of stress in software development.

Furthermore, thanks to our [iStoa simulation environment](download),
the developed DKMs are quickly available to end users. We have
developed [several documentations](our-actions) on programming, and in
particular with the Cuis-Smalltalk environment.

### Parent 

Imagine usage scenarios for DKMs to illustrate concepts for your
children. They undoubtedly have many questions that can be illustrated
with a DKM.

Another approach is to help them develop scripts; it is very
intellectually stimulating.

Do not hesitate to share your experience and remarks; we are
interested!
